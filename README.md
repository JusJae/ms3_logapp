### Database

### Schema Design

#### NoSQL: MongoDB Collections

##### Users collection

`{
    _id: ObjectId,  // Auto-generated by MongoDB
    username: String,
    email: String,
    password: String, // Hashed version of the password
}`

##### Products Collection

`
{
    "product_id": ObjectId,  // MongoDB's built-in unique identifier
    "product_name": String,
    "product_category": String,
    "date_added": Date,
    "product_notes": String,
    "image_url": String,
    "created_by": username  // Reference to User Collection
}`

##### User Session Collection

## Design

### Typography

Exo | Lato | sans-serif

The fonts that were used throughout the site are 'Exo', 'Lato' and sans-serif.  

Exo was used for heading and sub headings as it has a bold standout style that looks digital but welcoming to reflect the product logging tool.
'Lato' was used for buttons and call to action and menu for its ease of readability, as well as the body of text.

### Colour Scheme

#### Main Palette

#### Secondary Palette

### Wireframes

Wireframes were designed at the start of this project to map out the site but the site has slightly changed since it its original conception to simplify the layout and add different elements and remove unnecessary elements for current features.

In addition to not having originally planned to have a custom 404 page but adding it in during the project.

#### Desktop view

## Deployment

### MongoDB Setup

Create an account on MongoDB
Create a cluster of your choice following the instructions on MongoDB Atlas
Access the cluster you have created and create a database with name of your choice.
Under Overview tab, find connect button and click it.
Choose second connection method using MongoDB's native drivers. Choose driver Python and version that is suitable to you. You will find a connection string in the Connection String section which will be used to connect to MongoDB when you set up the environment locally and to deploy to Heroku.
Create an account with Heroku following the instructions from the site.

#### Forking the Repository

- Log in to GitHub and to find this project's respository: ms3-logapp.
- Locate and use the Fork button to create a copy of the repository to your Github account.
- You can now make edits to your copy of the project without affecting the original repository.

#### Create env.py file and .gitignore

- Create a `env.py` file in the root directory of the project using the `env_sample.py` file found in the in the directory.
- Please update with your MongoDB Connect details.
- Please ensure to add `env.py` and `__pycache__` to `.gitignore` to secure your MongoDB sensitive data

#### Venv Setup & Dependencies

To create a virtual environment in the root directory of the project.

- Type `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal and press Enter.
- Type `source venv/bin/activate` in the terminal and press Enter.
- Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal and press Enter.

#### Search Indexes Commands

- In order for you to have the search capabilities within the project site you will need to add search index commands to the MongoDB Database Collections.
<!-- This document was inspired from CI Project Walkthrough -->
- You can do this by following the commands in this document: [Search Index Commands](/docs/search-index-cmd.md)

### Remote Deployment

This site is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the **main** branch on GitHub. To implement this project on Heroku, the following steps were taken:

1. Create a **requirements.txt** file so Heroku can install the required dependencies to run the app.
   - `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
   - My file can be found [here](requirements.txt).
2. Create a **Procfile** to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it.
   - `echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
   - My file can be found [here](Procfile).

3. Sign up for a free Heroku account, create your project app, and click the **Deploy** tab, at which point you can *Connect GitHub* as the Deployment Method, and select *Enable Automatic Deployment*.
4. In the Heroku **Settings** tab, click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button to configure environmental variables as follows:
   - **IP** : `0.0.0.0`
   - **PORT** : `5000`
   - **MONGO_URI** : `<link to your Mongo DB>`
   - **SECRET_KEY** : `<your own secret key>`

5. Ensure that you set Debug:True to False before deployment.
6. Your app should be successfully deployed to Heroku at this point.
