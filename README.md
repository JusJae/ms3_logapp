### First Time User Goals

---

### User Stories

1. #### Account Management

	• As a new user, I want to register for an account so that I can access the product log app.
 • As a registered user, I want to log in to the application so that I can manage my product list.
 • As a registered user, I want to reset my password in case I forget it.

2. #### Product Management

	• As a user, I want to add a new product to my list, including its image, so that I can keep track of my products.
 • As a user, I want to view all my products in a list or grid view so that I can easily navigate through them.
 • As a user, I want to update the details of a product, including changing its image, to keep my product information current.
 • As a user, I want to delete a product from my list when I no longer need it.

3. #### Search and Filter

	• As a user, I want to search for a product by its name to quickly find specific products.
 • As a user, I want to filter products by categories to view products of a specific type.
 • As a user, I want to sort products by the date they were added to see recent additions first.
4. Navigation and Layout:
 • As a user, I want a responsive layout so that I can access the application effectively on both desktop and mobile devices.
 • As a user, I want a fixed bottom footer with relevant links and information.
 • As a user, I want a navigation menu to quickly move between different sections of the application.

5. #### Pagination and Performance

• As a user, I want to view products in paginated lists so that I don’t get overwhelmed with too much data at once and the app loads faster.
6. #### Accessibility:
 • As a user with visual impairments, I want the application to be screen-reader friendly so that I can navigate and use the app effectively.
 • As a user with motor impairments, I want to navigate the application using keyboard shortcuts.
7. #### Cloud Storage and Media Management:
 • As a user, I want my uploaded product images to be stored securely and load fast.
 • As a user, I want the application to only accept valid image files to ensure consistency and safety.
8. #### Error Handling and Feedback:
 • As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.
 • As a user, I want to receive feedback when my actions (like adding a product) are successful.

### Database

### Schema Design

#### NoSQL: MongoDB Collections

##### Users collection

`{
    _id: ObjectId,  // Auto-generated by MongoDB
    username: String,
    email: String,
    password: String, // Hashed version of the password
}`

##### Products Collection

`
{
    "product_id": ObjectId,  // MongoDB's built-in unique identifier
    "name": String,
    "category": String,
    "date_added": Date,
    "notes": String,
    "image_url": String,
    "user_id": ObjectId  // Reference to User Collection
}`

##### User Session Collection

`{
    "session_id": ObjectId,  // MongoDB's built-in unique identifier
    "login_time": Date,
    "logout_time": Date,
    "user_id": ObjectId  // Reference to User Collection
}`

## Design

### Typography

Exo | Lato | Oswald

The fonts that were used throughout the site are 'Exo', 'Lato' and 'Oswald'.  

Exo was used for heading and sub headings as it has a bold standout style that looks digital but welcoming to reflect the digital workout tool.
'Lato' was used for buttons and call to action and menu for its ease of readability.
Oswald was used for the body of text.

### Colour Scheme

#### Palette

Wireframes were designed at the start of this project to map out the site but the site has slightly changed since it its original conception to simplify the layout and add different elements and remove unnecessary elements for current features such as a music player.

In addition to not having originally planned to have a custom 404 page but adding it in during the project.

## Deployment

TODO:

- [ ] Update deployment for Heroku Flask Depolyment
- [ ] Add description on how user will need to create their own indexes in their db in order to search using > indexes_text_commands.md.

---

### Remote Deployment

This site is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the **main** branch on GitHub. To implement this project on Heroku, the following steps were taken:

1. Create a **requirements.txt** file so Heroku can install the required dependencies to run the app.
    - `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - My file can be found [here](requirements.txt).
2. Create a **Procfile** to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it.
    - `echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
    - My file can be found [here](Procfile).
3. Sign up for a free Heroku account, create your project app, and click the **Deploy** tab, at which point you can *Connect GitHub* as the Deployment Method, and select *Enable Automatic Deployment*.
4. In the Heroku **Settings** tab, click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button to configure environmental variables as follows:
    - **IP** : `0.0.0.0`
    - **PORT** : `8080`
    - **MONGO_URI** : `<link to your Mongo DB>`
    - **SECRET_KEY** : `<your own secret key>`

5. Your app should be successfully deployed to Heroku at this point.
