## Bugs

These are some of the bugs that I had to overcome whist in development of this project.

- Adjusting the positioning of elements in the navbar.
- Handling search functionality and error redirection when the user is not logged in.
- Modifying the user profile editing functionality to prevent duplicate usernames and to update passwords securely.
- Displaying the current password in an edit profile form but storing it hashed in the database.
- Fixing the login form redirection and flashed message display.
- Fixing linting errors specifically (E501) in Python code.
